Pull Requests: Each PR into master will get its own custom URL that is visible on the PR page. QA & validate changes on that URL before merging into the deploy branch.

👏🏽 Contributing Guidelines
We keep an updated list of bugs/feature requests in Github Issues.

GitHub issues

Filter by "good first issue" to get your feet wet! Once you submit a PR, our CI will generate a temporary testing URL where you can validate your changes. Tag any of the gatekeepers on the review to merge them into master.

NOTE: For big changes associated with feature releases/milestones, they will be merged onto the develop branch for more thorough QA before a final merge to master
